# [CalsiBot](https://t.me/CalsiBot) Translations Project

## Goal (*what's the point?*)
[CalsiBot](https://t.me/CalsiBot) has exploded in popularity recently, a much more diverse set of groups now rely on it to protect them from evil losers, or just to provide some fun features.

As such, I'd like to get it translated into a few of the most requested languages so that these non-English users don't feel like they're second-class citizens in the [CalsiBot](https://t.me/CalsiBot) world.

## Guidelines (*how can i help?*)
You can help in the following ways:
1. Finding typos and errors in the files for languages you are fluent in, and submitting [issues](https://github.com/CalsiBotDev/CalsiBot/issues/new) or [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) with suggested fixes.
1. Starring this repository to increase visibility.

## Reviews (*who grades my homework?*)
Once you've made some changes to a language file, please [make a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request).

Then, always request the following people [as reviewers](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).
1. Me, [@CalsiBotDev](https://github.com/CalsiBotDev)

## Will you add X? (*language requests*)
You can see the list of languages [CalsiBot](https://t.me/CalsiBot) currently supports above. These languages were chosen because they were requested most by users.

If you think that there is a legitimate need for another language and you are able to contribute and aid in perfecting the translation for it (not easy!) then please [make a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) with all the details.

## What's HJSON? (*awesome, mainly.*)
You may be wondering why all the language files end with `.hjson`, well HJSON is basically human-readable JSON. If that's something that sounds interesting to you, you can find out more on [their official site](https://hjson.org/)

This way, the translation files can easily be converted to JSON for bot-consumption, while the original HJSON version allows us to add comments and spacing - making the experience of the translators a bit nicer.

It's still a bit of a wall of text though, so if you have ideas on how to improve the syntax of the files further (that don't involve using some external translation site) then please [make an issue](https://github.com/CalsiBotDev/CalsiBot/issues/new) or [message me](https://t.me/cancer) to let me know.
